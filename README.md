**Description:**
RADENNX is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for the rapid development of neural networks, particularly for classification and regression problems. Initially named RADENN, it was implemented using ANTLR4 to provide a structured and efficient way to define neural network architectures with simplicity and flexibility. This project is based on a research paper titled **RADENN**, and the link to the paper is provided below.
